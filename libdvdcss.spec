%description
libdvdcss is a simple library designed for accessing DVDs like a block device
without having to bother about the decryption. The important features are:
 * Portability. Currently supported platforms are GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
   OpenBSD, BSD/OS, BeOS, Windows 95/98, Windows NT/2000, MacOS X, Solaris,
   and HP-UX.
 * Simplicity. There are currently 7 functions in the API, and we intend to
   keep this number low.
 * Freedom. libdvdcss is released under the General Public License, ensuring
   it will stay free, and used only for free software products.
 * Just better. Unlike most similar projects, libdvdcss doesn't require the
   region of your drive to be set.
