# ChangeLog for libdvdcss #
#=========================#

HEAD

  * ./src/ioctl.c, ./src/ioctl.h: QNX port, courtesy of Pascal Levesque.
  * ./src/css.c: applied Håkan's fix for the failure on region mismatch.
  * ALL: switched to libtool 1.4.2a.
  * ./src/libdvdcss.c: fixed an uninitialized variable.

1.2.0
Mon, 20 May 2002 19:48:42 +0200

  * ./src/libdvdcss.c: new function _dvdcss_use_ioctls. Avoid using the ioctl
    calls when they have no chance of working, this in turn avoids a spurious
    warning when they fail.
  * ./src/css.c: updated error messages.
  * ./src/libdvdcss.c: default to 'key', rather than 'title', method.
  * ./libdvdcss.spec: enhancements by Mandrakesoft.
  * ./src/libdvdcss.c: corrected a serious bug in dvdcss_read for titles with
    all zero key (a unencrypted title on a CSS protected disc).
  * ./src/ioctl.[ch]: Darwin changes: cleaned up the code, fixed
    ReadTitleKey, and implemented ReportRPC.
  * ./INSTALL: updated win32 compilation instructions.

1.1.1
Sat,  6 Apr 2002 03:24:20 +0200

  * ./src/ioctl.c: OpenBSD compile fix. Thanks to ex0dus on #videolan.
  * ./src/libdvdcss.h: IRIX compile fix by Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>.
  * ./configure.in: BeOS bug fix. I'm so lame.
  * ./src/ioctl.c: refuse to build if DVD ioctls weren't found.

1.1.0
Wed,  3 Apr 2002 18:26:23 +0200

  * ./test/csstest.c: renamed test.c to csstest.c.
  * ./src/ioctl.c: fixed a Darwin typo recently introduced.
  * ./configure.in: Darwin compile fix (added -no-cpp-precomp).
  * ./libdvdcss.spec: updated specfile for RPM generation.
  * ./missing: commited libtool's latest version of this file.
  * ./configure.in: fixed a Darwin define problem.
  * ./src/dvdcss/dvdcss.h: moved dvdcss.h in a subdirectory so that we can
    include <dvdcss/dvdcss.h> without having to make install.
  * ./test/test.c: removed #ifdef DVDCSS_DIST.
  * ./Makefile.am: added the debian dir to the targets.
  * ./configure.in: switched to a more conventional versioning scheme.
  * ./src/css.c: removed a useless #ifdef.
  * ./src/dvdcss.h: added a versioned symbol to the API.
  * ./src/Makefile.am: use <dvdcss/dvdcss.h> instead of <videolan/dvdcss.h>.
  * ./test/test.c: test program is now up to date.
  * ./src/css.c: split the code into more functions. The disc and title
    decryption / cracking code is now each in it's own function. Also moved the
    code that looks for a weak block in the VOB to crack the title key from out
    from the loop that reads them.
  * ./src/css.c: added another crack method, it's disabled for now though.
  * ./src/css.c: lowered some limits on the current 'weak' test.
  * ./src/*: added more comments.
  * ./configure.in: add -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to the compile line to make
    off_t / lseek and other file access functions used in dvdcss be 64bit.
  * ./test/test.c: tell libdvdcss to get the key for the block before we
    decrypt it.
  * ./test/Makefile.am: don't link to libdl.
  * ./configure.in: fixed compilation of test/test.c.
  * ./test/test.c: added the sample program.
  * ./configure.in: do check for the unistd.h header file.
  * ./src/css.c: Win32 (NT/2000/XP) fix: first attempt to open the DVD device
    in read/write mode so we can use ioctls. If this fails (insufficent
    privileges) we at least open in read-only mode so the libdvdcss title
    decryption method can be used.
  * ./src/libdvdcss.c: patch of libdvdcss to decrypt vobs when they are not
    on a block device.
  * ./src/css.c: with DVDCSS_METHOD=disc or key, the keys are no longer
    buffered on start. The title key is still read at each block but it is
    checked for change before decryption.
  * ./src/css.c: made CSSAuth more rubust, should now also work with drives
    that are not 100% compliant to the SFF-8090 standard.
  * ./src/css.c: AGID invalidation should now work, allowing us to recover from
    hung / failed authentications.
  * ./src/css.c: corrected CSSGetASF, it does not take an AGID argument.
  * ./src/css.c: moved several data structures from the dvdcss handle to local
    variables in CSSAuth.
  * ./src/css.h: removed CSSAuth as a externaly visible function in css.c.
  * ./configure.in, ./src/libdvdcss.c: Win32 compilation fix.
  * ./configure.in: attempt at fixing the Solaris port.
  * ./src/css.c: Support for REPORT_TITLE_KEY and RPC commands by Håkan Hjort
    <d95hjort@dtek.chalmers.se>.
  * ./src/ioctl.c: HP-UX port courtesy of David Siebörger
    <drs-videolan@rucus.ru.ac.za>.

1.0.1
Fri,  7 Dec 2001 20:18:56 +0100

  * Update for libdvdcss documentation.
  * Reworked Keith Packard's raw device patch. The name of the raw device
    is in the environment variable DVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE.
  * Fixed a bug in libdvdcss: the key wasn't searched when it had to.

1.0.0
Mon, 12 Nov 2001 17:14:29 +0100

  * Got rid of DVDCSS_SEEK_INI.
  * Removed the i_flags argument to dvdcss_open. Everything is done through
    environment variables now.
  * Fixed a buffer overflow in CSSAuth().
  * libdvdcss port to OpenBSD.
  * Fixed NetBSD (and probably OpenBSD) libdvdcss compilation.
  * Fixed undefined KEY_SIZE compile bug mentioned by Dave Thorup.
  * Fixed CSS ioctl for Darwin/OSX - still might need tweaking of 'dataLength'
    fields.
  * Added ReadTitleKey ioctl for Darwin/OSX.
  * When using title cracking method in libdvdcss, the key is only checked at
    title start, not before each chapter.
  * Use of an environment variable to choose libdvdcss method.
  * New features for libdvdcss: we have three ways now to decode a title key.
  * 1) Crack the title key (the method that was here before). The only change
    here is that we search the key for the exact chapter we are seeking with
    DVDSetArea (in case the key has changed within a title). It is maybe not a
    good idea.
  * 2) Crack the disc key, which allows us to decode instantly all title keys.
    I've used an algorithm from Frank Stevenson ; it eats much memory (64MB),
    and takes about 15 s at launch time.
  * 3) Decode the disc key with player keys (libcss method). However, you need
    licensed player keys at build time for this to work.
  * Darwin ioctl, courtesy of ej0.
  * If we see 3000 unencrypted blocks assume that the title is unencrypted.
  * If we have not seen any encrypted block and then discover that the block
    just read is not a valid block of an MPEG2 Program stream, assume that the
    title is unencrypted.
  * Empty keys (for unscrambled sectors) are now cached as well.
  * We try to decrypt the file even if DVD ioctls are not available.

0.0.3
Wed, 22 Aug 2001 15:18:01 +0200

  * Added BSD/OS libdvd by Steven M. Schultz <sms@TO.GD-ES.COM> in
    extras/BSDI_dvdioctl after he suggested us to do so. License is GPL.
  * ./configure now checks for an installed libdvd under BSD/OS and
    falls back to ours if not found.
  * Fixed harmless typos in yesterday's Solaris libdvd patches.
  * Bumped libdvdcss version number up to 0.0.3.
  * Solaris DVD decryption support by Håkan Hjort <d95hjort@dtek.chalmers.se>.
  * BSD/OS 4.3beta1 fixes by Steven M. Schultz <sms@TO.GD-ES.COM>.
  * libdvdcss* packages are now a bit more policy-compliant.
  * Fixed a Win32 bug in libdvdcss. This bug was appearing on title change.

0.0.2
Wed, 22 Aug 2001 15:18:01 +0200

  * Fix in libdvdcss in the key caching code.
  * Changed libdvdcss API to force binary incompatibility. Yeah, this is
    evil, but if we don't do it now we'll have to do it when more people
    are using it.
  * Fixed minor libdvdcss stuff such as the soname and compilation flags.
  * dvdcss_readv() optimisations for Win32.
  * Fixed _win32_dvdcss_aread() to work around the WinASPI32 64kb transfer
    size restriction.
  * libdvdcss segfault fixes.
  * Fixed 2 Win32 bugs in libdvdcss (in _win32_dvdcss_readv), one of them
    should have prevented the Win9x dvd input from working.
  * Moved the "if(Win2k)" out of the loop in _win32_dvdcss_readv.
  * libdvdcss enhancements by Billy Biggs <vektor@dumbterm.net>. This breaks
    vlc's DVD input (looks like decoders are expecting data too early and
    DVD input can't cope with it due to decryption). Needs to be investigated.
  * Removed unnecessary translations in the win32 code from block offsets to
    byte offsets. This was overflowing some variables.
  * Reduced the complexity of the Win9x ASPI functions because we only need
    to handle DVD drive access.
  * Win32 code now handles seeking in areas above 2.1 Go on DVDs.
  * Additional MacOS X DVD ioctl work by Eugenio Jarosiewicz
    <ej0@cise.ufl.edu>.

0.0.1
Tue, 19 Jun 2001 08:53:16 +0200

  * First libdvdcss version (0.0.1).
  * Fully working Windows DVD ioctl support by Jon Lech Johansen.
  * Merged dvdcss_init and dvdcss_open into dvdcss_open, and dvdcss_close
    and dvdcss_end into dvdcss_close. libdvdcss API now has 7 functions.
  * Exported the CSS part of the dvd plugin into a library.
