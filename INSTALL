INSTALL file for libdvdcss, a DVD access library


Configuring libdvdcss
=====================

A typical way to configure libdvdcss is:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr

See `./configure --help' for more information.

Building libdvdcss
==================

Once configured, run `make' to build libdvdcss.

If you have player keys, you need to put them in the file csskeys.h, before
configuring libdvdcss to enable the "key" method (the one from libcss).


Installing libdvdcss
====================

You can install libdvdcss by typing:

   make install


Building libdvdcss for Win32
============================

You have two alternatives to build libdvdcss for Win32:

- natively on Windows, using MSYS+MINGW (www.mingw.org):

 (MSYS is a minimal build environnement to compile unixish projects under
  windoze. It provides all the common unix tools like sh, gmake...)

 You need to download and install MSYS-1.0.5 (version 1.0.6 doesn't seem to
 work as well) and MINGW.
 http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/msys-1.0.5-i686-bin.tar.gz
 http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-1.1.tar.gz

 To build libdvdcss you just have to run the following commands:

  MAKE=gmake ./configure

  MAKE=gmake gmake

- or on Linux, using the mingw32 cross-compiler:

 You can find a mingw32 cross-compiler on the videolan web site:
 http://www.videolan.org/vlc/windows.html
 Or if you are running Debian, there is a mingw32 package you can use.

 If you are cross-compiling from the Debian package, you can use the following
 commands:

  ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc \
  --build=i386-linux

  make

 If you are cross-compiling using the mingw32 package provided by
 www.videolan.org, you have to use something along those lines:

  CC=/usr/local/cross-tools/bin/i586-mingw32msvc-gcc \
  PATH=/usr/local/cross-tools/bin:$PATH \
  ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc \
  --build=i386-linux

  PATH=/usr/local/cross-tools/bin:$PATH make
